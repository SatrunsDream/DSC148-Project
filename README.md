## Introduction

## 1 Dataset
### 1.1 Identify a dataset
* The dataset should be large enough (e.g., 50,000 instances in total)
### 1.2 Perform an exploratory data analysis
* Basic Statistics
* Properties
* Interesting findings
### 1.3 Data cleaning
### 1.4 Findings in exploratory data analysis
* EDA should motivate your model design/choice

## 2. Predictive Task
### 2.1 Predictive task
* Identify a predictive task based on your dataset
### 2.2 Evaluation
* 2.2 How will you evaluate different models in this task?
### 2.3 Generalization
### 2.4 Baseline
* What are the baseline models you want to compare with?
* Why do you think they are appropriate?
* Why do you think your model can outperform them? Or say, what are their drawbacks?
### 2.5 Baseline result

## 3. Model
### 3.1 Initial settings
* What is the model that you propose to attack this task?
* It’s fine to use models that were described in class here
* Explain and justify your choice/proposal What are the features you designed for your model?
* Any unsuccessful tries?
### 3.2 Basic hyperparameter tuning
### 3.3 Feature engineering
### 3.4 Model optimzation
* How will you optimize your model?
* It’s fine here to call any 3rd party libs
* Did you encounter any troubles? Scalability? Overfitting?
### 3.5 Final optimization result

## 4. Literature
* Has your dataset/task been studied by others before?
* How the dataset was used?
* Are you working on a brand-new task?
* How are other people attacking the same/similar tasks?
* What is state-of-the-art method in this task or related tasks?
* Are your conclusions similar or different from existing work?
* What’s the major novelty of your work?

## 5. Result
### 5.1 Comparison
* Does your proposed method outperform the baselines?
* Why your model can outperform? Or why your model fails?
* Whether the gap is significant?
### 5.2 Effectiveness
* Are all features you designed effective?
### 5.3 Hyperparameters
* How shall one set the hyper-parameters of your model?
### 5.4 Major takeaways
* What are the major takeaways (i.e., conclusions)?
